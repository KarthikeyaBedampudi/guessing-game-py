# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple number guessing game implemented in Python. The program picks a random number between 1 and 200, and the player has up to 6 guesses to find the correct number. After each guess, the program will indicate whether the guessed number is too high or too low. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number or runs out of guesses. The player is then given an option to play again.

## How to Play

1. The program will ask for your name.
2. The program will generate a random number between 1 and 200.
3. You will have 6 attempts to guess the number.
4. After each guess, the program will inform you if your guess is too high or too low.
5. If you guess the number within 6 tries, you win.
6. If you do not guess the number within 6 tries, you lose and the correct number is revealed.
7. After each game, you will be asked if you want to play again. Type "yes" or "y" to play again, and anything else to exit.
